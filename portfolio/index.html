      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science graduate with a growing passion for building
        responsive, user-friendly web interfaces. While studying, I spent 4+
        years working as a satellite dish installer — an experience that
        sharpened my hands-on problem solving and customer-facing communication
        skills. Currently, I’m focused on frontend web development, learning
        tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I love turning creative
        ideas into functional, accessible web experiences.
